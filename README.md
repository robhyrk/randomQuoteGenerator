<h1> Random Quote Generator </h1>
<h2>Displays random quote from array of objects</h2>

<h3>Created by Rob Hyrkiel</h3>

<p>This app generates a random quote stored in an array of objects.</p>
<p>It has been designed to show each quote once before repeating the quote again. This is done through the use of a counter variable and a function that splices the quote from the array and then pushes that object back to the end of the original array.</p>
<p>A random background color is also generated each time the user clicks to display a new quote.</p>
<p>Lastly, the setInterval() method is used to display a new quote every 5 seconds whether the user clicks the 'show another quote' button or not.</p>
