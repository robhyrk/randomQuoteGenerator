# randomQuoteGenerator
Displays random quote from array of objects

Created by Rob Hyrkiel

This app generates a random quote stored in an array of objects.
It has been designed to show each quote once before repeating the quote again. This is done through the use of a counter variable and a function that splices the quote from the array and then pushes that object back to the end of the original array.
A random background color is also generated each time the user clicks to display a new quote.
Lastly, the setInterval() method is used to display a new quote every 5 seconds whether the user clicks the 'show another quote' button or not.
